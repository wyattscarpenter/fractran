A simple implementation of John Conway's FRACTRAN https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRACTRAN

Compile the program (using make or otherwise) and then pipe your programs into the executable. It will print the result out to standard out.

I just made this project for fun, and release it into the public domain under CC0. However, I did not invent the fractran programs in this project, I found them on the internet; it is unclear to me what sort copyright may apply to them. It may be impossible to copyright a string of fewer than 20 numbers, or I may now hold the copyright simply because I added comments and/or formatting. Nevertheless, I release whatever rights over them I do hold into the public domain under CC0.
